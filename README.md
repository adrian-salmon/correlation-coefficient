# ðŸ“˜ Correlation Coefficient Interactive

This interactive shows users what different **correlation values (r values)** look like by automatically updating a scatter plot as the r value is changed. Users can select a specific r value, and the graph dynamically generates a set of points that match that correlation. This helps users **visualize the strength and direction** of relationships ranging from strong positive to strong negative correlation.
